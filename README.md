# Seralization demo

This project is to showcase some of Java's Serialization flaws.
You can try them for yourself!

# Flaws

1. Encapsulation - Serialization throws encapsulation / accessibility out of the window
1. Inheritance + No guarantee's - See what happens when you add a Pet to Person.
1. Serialization framework comes with a bunch of methods / variables like `serialVersionUID`
